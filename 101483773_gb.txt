This will be a text document containing some information about George Brown College.

- George Brown College has 3 campuses
- I'm currently attending a program being taught at the Casa Loma Campus, however my program
is fully online

- I've also decided to further my education as well. I used to be in T191, but now I decided
that I want to continue, and so I was accepted into T187!
