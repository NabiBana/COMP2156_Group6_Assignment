This document will contain some information about COMP 3104 and my thoughts
on the course so far.

This course will give preliminary information about the resources DevOps engineers use
in order to do the work they need. So far the focus of the course has been about GitHub.

In addition, comp3104 is my favourite course that I'm taking this semester. It's been
very interesting and, I'm engaged in class, running the appropriate commands and, I'm learning
Linux a lot more as a result.
