Importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle:
DevOps has a thing called CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous delivery/deployment) which helps teams release updates really quick without any delays by automating important steps in the software development cycle.
DevOps can make the time to develop, test and deploy the software shorter.
Stronger security (automated security scans can help to catch issues quickely).
DevOps helps to set up systems like servers automatically by using tools like Ansible so you don't have to do that much work manually.
