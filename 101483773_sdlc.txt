Learning DevOps is essential in the software development cycle because it bridges
the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable
software delivery. By integrating automation, continuous integration/continuous
deployment (CI/CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC), DevOps enhances efficiency,
reduces errors, and improves collaboration among teams. It also helps developers
quickly identify and fix issues, leading to higher-quality software and better user
experiences. As modern software development demands agility and scalability,
understanding DevOps principles is crucial for any aspiring software engineer
or IT professional.

I'm not quite sure what else to add here, I just know that I have 10 commits to complete
so, I'm just adding some words here and there to this document so, I can commit a new

Funny enough, this will be my 3rd commit for this text and I still don't know what else to add.

This will be the last commit for this document. Farewell
