Learning DevOps is essential in the software development cycle because it bridges
the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable
software delivery. By integrating automation, continuous integration/continuous
deployment (CI/CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC), DevOps enhances efficiency,
reduces errors, and improves collaboration among teams. It also helps developers
quickly identify and fix issues, leading to higher-quality software and better user
experiences. As modern software development demands agility and scalability,
understanding DevOps principles is crucial for any aspiring software engineer
or IT professional.
