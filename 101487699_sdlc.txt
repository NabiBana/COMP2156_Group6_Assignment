Importance of Learning DevOps in the Software Development Cycle
DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development by bridging the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops).
It enhances the efficiency, reliability, and speed of software delivery.

Four reasons why DevOps is essential:

1. Faster Development & Deployment 🚀
DevOps automates software development processes using Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
Reduces the time between writing code and deploying it to production.
2. Improved Collaboration & Communication 🤝
Breaks silos between developers, testers, and IT operations.
Promotes a culture of shared responsibility and continuous feedback.
3. Higher Software Quality & Stability 🛠
Automated testing and monitoring ensure fewer bugs.
Continuous feedback loops allow quick fixes and improvements.
4. Scalability & Reliability 💡
Cloud-based DevOps solutions (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) allow software to scale efficiently.
Ensures high availability with tools like Kubernetes and Docker.
