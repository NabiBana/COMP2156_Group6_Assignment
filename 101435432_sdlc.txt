DevOps plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 
by ensuring seamless integration between development and operations teams. 
It enhances collaboration, accelerates deployment, automates testing, and 
improves software reliability.

Key Benefits of DevOps in SDLC:
- Faster development and deployment cycles
- Early bug detection through continuous testing
- Improved collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams
- Automated infrastructure management
- Better scalability and reliability of software applications

Adopting DevOps practices leads to faster time-to-market and higher-quality 
software products.
